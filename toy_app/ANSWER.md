The CSS ID (that is, the HTML "id" attribute) for the text "User was
successfully created." is "notice". When we refresh the browser, the HTML
element (which is a paragraph) is still there, along with the HTML ID attribute,
however since there is nothing inside the paragraph element, nothing shows up.
