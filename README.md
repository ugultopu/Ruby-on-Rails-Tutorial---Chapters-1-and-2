Ruby on Rails Tutorial
======================

This repository contains my implementations for [Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails
tutorial][Ruby on Rails Tutorial]. My answers for the exercises that appear at
various places in the book can be found at branches that follow the naming
structure `exercise-<section-number>-<exercise-number>`. For example, the answer
to the exercise 2 of section 1.2.4 can be found in a branch named
`exercise-1.2.4-2`, and within that branch, in a file named `ANSWER.md`. The
`ANSWER.md` file is located either on the root of the project directory, or in a
folder named `EXERCISE_ANSWER`, which is on the root of the project directory.

You can also find my notes about the places that I find particularly important
in the tutorial in a file named [NOTES.md][Notes].
